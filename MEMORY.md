## Core Privacy & Security Boundaries
- **Photos**: NEVER access the local photo library, `~/Pictures` directory, or any personal photo files. This is a strict prohibition from the user (2026-02-13).
- **GitHub**: Only push files to the `ecommerce-demo` repository when requested.
- **Passwords**: Access Bitwarden only when the user provides a session key.

## Project Context
- **Vehicle Archive**: Maintaining a GitHub-based offline car archive for CarSensor listings.
- **Tools Configured**: `single-file-cli` installed for offline page saving.

## User Preferences
- Prefers GitHub Pages for permanent storage of web archives.
- Local workspace should be kept clean; temporary files should be deleted after deployment.
